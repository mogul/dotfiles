# Notes on stuff to break out/automate later

- Sublime Text config
	- Install cobalt2 Sublime Text theme
  		- http://wesbos.com/cobalt2-theme-sublime-text-2/
	- Set Hack as the font in Sublime:
  		- "font_face": "Hack",
- Put .gitconfig (mostly) under version control - need to abstract out context-local parts!
- Figure out how to fully-automate the [install of node+npm without sudo](http://www.johnpapa.net/how-to-use-npm-global-without-sudo-on-osx/)
- Figure out how to post-process to install Node apps, eg
  - `npm install -g takana`
  - `npm install -g jshint`
- Figure out post-process for sym-linking ~/.dotfiles/path (eg ssh, gnupg, etc.) to their corresponding ~/.path
  - For sublime: `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/sublime/User/ ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User`
- Script in [installation of rvm](http://portertech.ca/2010/03/26/homebrew--rvm--awesome/)
