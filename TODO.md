# Notes on stuff to break out/automate later

- Sublime Text config
	- Install cobalt2 Sublime Text theme
  		- http://wesbos.com/cobalt2-theme-sublime-text-2/
	- Set Hack as the font in Sublime:
  		- "font_face": "Hack",
- Put .gitconfig (mostly) under version control - need to abstract out context-local parts!
- Figure out how to fully-automate the [install of node+npm without sudo](http://www.johnpapa.net/how-to-use-npm-global-without-sudo-on-osx/)
- Figure out how to post-process to install Node apps, eg
  - npm install -g takana
  - npm install -g jshint
